Motivation

 gen_paxos is to be a generic paxos module, easy to use in distributed system.
paxos implementation is to be a large finite state machine. My motivation is
to reduce the cost of re-invention of wheels.


Current status

 a prototype of paxos consensus protocol has successfully worked.


Future works

 - to refine the code so as to work as a generic erlang module.
 - automation of basic tests.
 - to expand coverege of tested combinations of states.
   - because paxos is complex FSM as a whole
 - to create a gen_leader compatible interface? 
   - gen_leader http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~hanssv/leader_election/


Related works

 - libpaxos (http://sourceforge.net/projects/libpaxos) 
 libpaxos is almost same implementation of PAXOS consensus protocol. it has Simple 
 version and Fast version of paxos and seems well working. it's implementation 
 has paxos coordinator process which can be SPOF in a really distributed 
 environment, which is solved in gen_paxos.
